## Elegant Launcher 1.1
A game launcher interface for PC, aim to require less customization work while provide more aesthetic.  
Only require a game wallpaper.

This skin work by carefully crop the image and move the panels at the same time and precisely to achieve this effect. The skin does not resize images (unless config to) so it would run faster than i expected, rather, it depend on render resolution and hardware (you can resize skin to increase fps). Plus, it is optimized by hiding invisible images, only crop/move image that are visible, all calculation are relied on lua script for much more cpu efficient.  
This actually took a long time to write.  

## Feature
* Dynamic, you can add as much as 50 apps or more, I don't recommend doing that though.  
* Navigate with mouse wheel or arrow keys, escape to exit.  
* Work with controller, activate launcher with Start (only when explorer or rainmeter in foreground, not to interfere with user activity).  
* Smooth scrolling animation.  
* Wizard interface for editing, layout configure and more  
* Allow swap game position.  
* Only load visible image as first, greatly increase startup time.  

## Installation
Require rainmeter 4+ and windows 10.  
Download rainmeter at https://www.rainmeter.net/.  
Download and install [skin file](https://github.com/callmeEthan/ElegantLauncher/raw/master/elegant_launcher_v1_1_for_rainmeter.rmskin)  
  
I highly recommend Rainmeter 4.3 beta r3266, there are cropping issues with newer version (May get fixed in the future)  
Rainmeter 4.3 use Direct2D and support **hardware acceleration**, this help larger skin and animation runs MUCH smoother. (depend on your hardware)  


## Usage
For best visual, please use background images that is equal or bigger than skin size (skin size = display width by default)
